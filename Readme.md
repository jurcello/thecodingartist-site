# The coding artist site

This repository holds the code for 'the coding artist' website.
The aim for the project is to start with a single html file site without styling or scripting
that evolves into a modern decoupled site.

This repository can therefore be regarded as an example of the content first approach as advocated by Stephen Hay.
