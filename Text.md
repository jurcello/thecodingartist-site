# My profile

After spending 8 years in Drupal development I wish to broaden my view and master new technologies.

# My conviction

I believe that craftsmanship in any profession starts with a deep understanding of the subject.

Apart from that I think best results in a profession can be achieved by studying other disciplines as well. It doesn't seem obvious at first, but my education in cello helped me to be a better programmer: the discipline to practice every day and the need to try out different interpretations are also highly beneficial in a my work as a coder.

Mastering different coding languages helps to be more creative in finding solutions. The knowledge of several programming paradigms (OO, functional, procedural) is necessary to solve problems.

While reading the above, one might think that I advocate a broad but shallow view. That's not the case. I believe that whatever you're doing, you should always strive for expert level craftsmanship.

# What I do

## Drupal

For 7 years I have been co-owner of a Drupal company, Triquanta. I was the technical director and Drupal backend expert and created backend systems for small to medium sized sites.
In many projects I integrated the search engine Apache Solr.
I also implemented Devops using Ansible for server provisioning and Jenkins for Continuous integration.
As an active member of the Drupal community, I initiated the Drupal Tech Talks in the Netherlands.
I have been training developers to learn Drupal site building, Drupal backend development and Apache Solr.

## Recent work

After working for a year as Drupal 8 developer and team lead at a big media company creating big American sites,
I shifted to javascript and React Native in order to gain knowledge of App Development.
In accordance with my conviction, I first studied Javascript and the background of Javascript extensively, so I could understand
the underlying concepts first before applying those in React Native using ES6.
The backend of the apps I have made where created in Django (python) and deployed using Docker.

## Creative coding

In the past 15 years I created Photonic Cello, an advanced system to control light using sound.
It was build using Max4Live and custom code in Java. I recently started the rewrite of the system in Cinder, which
is a creative coding framework written in C++.
