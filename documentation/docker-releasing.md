# Releasing using docker

Different than in most docker tutorials , the docker compose file and the docker files are not in the root of the project,
The command however is not different. Be ware of the docker files: they are written as if they would be in the root of the project.

<pre>docker-compose stop</pre>
<pre>docker-compose build</pre>
<pre>docker-compose up -d</pre>
