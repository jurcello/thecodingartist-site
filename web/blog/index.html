<h2>Learning the C++ creative coding framework Cinder</h2>
<p>Because I am an artist and I like to code, I decided that I wanted to learn a creative coding framework.
After speaking to a game developer I decided to learn Cinder, as I heard that this framework is used by some leading companies like the Barbarian Group.</p>

<p>As always I started looking on the internet for some (video) tutorials. Unfortunately there where not that many tutorials available and
many where outdated. Although the samples provided in the download of Cinder where somewhat helpful, they where quite overwhelming.
I decided to use the old fashioned way of buying a book and learning from that book. I only found 2 books, of which I took the packt publishing book 'Cinder Creative Coding Cookbook'.
I just started working through the book, coding all the recipes myself. From the recipes I extracted some skills (like using the Camera in 3D or creating a UI for manipulating variables)
    that I thought I should learn by heart, because looking up code that you use a lot takes time. I noted these skills in a spreadsheet and added some time every day
    to practice these skills in the same way I practised scales everyday when I studied cello.
</p>
<p>
    After doing this for a week, I noticed that, like studying scales, this way of working gets boring. That's why I decided
    to also start a project to build something really useful using Cinder. I also noticed that I lacked some knowledge of C++,
    so I also decided to buy a course on Udemy about advanced C++ and watch that tutorials as part of my daily routine.
