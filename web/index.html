<h1>The coding artist</h1>

<h2>What's in the name?</h2>

<p>I am Jur de Vries, an independent software developer and musician/artist. Because I am doing both on a professional level, I am a coding artist.</p>

<h2>My philosophy</h2>

<p>I believe that craftsmanship in any profession starts with a real understanding of the subject.
    Apart from that I think best results in a profession can be achieved by studying other professions as well.
    Although not logical at first sight, my education in cello helped me to be a better coder: the discipline to practice every day, the need to try out different interpretations for instance
are highly beneficial when coding.</p>

<p>This all might indicate that I advocate a shallow but broad view. That's not the case. I believe that when you do something, you should strive for expert level craftsmanship.</p>

<h2>What I do</h2>

<p>I was co-owner of a Drupal company for 7 years. In this company I was the technical director and I focussed on being a Drupal backend expert.
I also gained a lot of knowledge about the Apache Solr search engine and about linux server configuration.</p>

<p>At the moment I am expert in the following fields:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Drupal (7 and 8) module development</li>
    <li>Drupal (7 and 8) site building</li>
    <li>Apache Solr index configuration</li>
    <li>PHP development</li>
    <li>Drupal and Solr training</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently I take a break from payed work to focus on learning the following things:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cinder creative coding framework (c++ based)</li>
    <li>Python based web development</li>
    <li>Inspirational talks</li>
</ul>

<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>
    As real understanding of subjects starts from base knowledge, I am convinced that the creation of a web site starts with the content.
    That's why I create this site in stages, starting from a one page html file without any styling or scripting to a fully decoupled site using a content management system.
